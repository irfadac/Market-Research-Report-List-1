<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Die Separator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Automatic</li><li>Semi-automatic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The die separator market comprises two main types: automatic and semi-automatic. Automatic die separators are fully automated machines designed to separate dies from wafer substrates without human intervention. These machines offer high precision and efficiency, capable of handling large volumes of dies. On the other hand, semi-automatic die separators require some level of human interaction, such as loading and unloading the dies. While these machines offer lower overall throughput compared to automatic ones, they are often more flexible and cost-effective for smaller-scale operations or prototype production.</p></p>
