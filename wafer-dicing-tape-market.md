<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wafer Dicing Tape Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Double Coated Type</li><li>Single Coated Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The wafer dicing tape market consists of two types: double coated type and single coated type. Double coated type refers to a tape that has adhesive on both sides, providing strong adhesion to both the wafer and the dicing frame or chuck during the dicing process. Single coated type, on the other hand, has adhesive only on one side, typically used for temporary bonding of the wafer to the dicing frame or chuck. Both types play a crucial role in securely holding the wafer during the dicing procedure to ensure precise cutting.</p></p>
