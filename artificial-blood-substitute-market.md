<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Artificial Blood Substitute Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Perfluorocarbon-based Oxygen Carrier (PFBOC)</li><li>Hemoglobin-based Oxygen Carrier (HBOC)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Artificial blood substitutes are classified into two main types: Perfluorocarbon-based Oxygen Carriers (PFBOCs) and Hemoglobin-based Oxygen Carriers (HBOCs). PFBOCs are synthetic compounds with high oxygen-carrying capacity that can dissolve and transport oxygen. They have advantages like long shelf life and absence of immunological reactions. HBOCs, on the other hand, are derived from human or bovine hemoglobin and are designed to deliver oxygen to tissues. They offer advantages such as better oxygen-carrying capacity and longer circulation time but may lead to adverse effects like hypertension. Both types aim to serve as alternatives to whole blood transfusions.</p></p>
