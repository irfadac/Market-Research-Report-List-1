<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Mapping Camera System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Linear Array Scanners (Pushbroom)</li><li>Systems based on Area Arrays</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Digital mapping camera systems can be categorized into two types: linear array scanners (pushbroom) and systems based on area arrays. </p><p>Linear array scanners, also known as pushbroom scanners, capture images through a single line of sensors that continuously scans the ground as the aircraft moves forward. This allows for high-resolution and wide-area coverage, making them suitable for large-scale mapping applications.</p><p>On the other hand, systems based on area arrays capture images using a two-dimensional array of sensors. These systems provide a wider field of view and can capture imagery from multiple directions, making them ideal for applications such as aerial reconnaissance and surveillance.</p></p>
