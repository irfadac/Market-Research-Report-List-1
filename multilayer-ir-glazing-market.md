<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multilayer IR Glazing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CoatedGlass</li><li>ReflectingGlass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multilayer IR glazing is divided into two main types: coated glass and reflecting glass. Coated glass incorporates multiple layers of thin films that selectively filter out infrared radiation, while allowing visible light to pass through. Reflecting glass, on the other hand, utilizes a metallic coating to reflect infrared radiation away from the building. Both types of multilayer IR glazing help to improve energy efficiency in buildings by reducing heat transfer and controlling solar heat gain.</p></p>
