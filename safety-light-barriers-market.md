<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Safety Light Barriers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>4-type Safety Light Barriers</li><li>2-type Safety Light Barriers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Safety light barriers are protective devices used in industrial settings to detect the presence of objects and prevent potential hazards. There are two main types of safety light barriers: the 4-type and 2-type. The 4-type safety light barriers consist of a sender and receiver unit, ensuring a higher level of safety by creating a light beam grid. On the other hand, the 2-type safety light barriers use only a sender unit, which emits a light beam that, when interrupted, triggers an alarm or safety measure. Both types play a crucial role in safeguarding workers and preventing accidents in the workplace.</p></p>
