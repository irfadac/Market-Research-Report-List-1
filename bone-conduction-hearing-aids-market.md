<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bone Conduction Hearing Aids Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable</li><li>Non-implantable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bone conduction hearing aids are devices that help individuals with hearing loss by transmitting sound vibrations through the bones of the skull. The market for these aids can be divided into two types: implantable and non-implantable. Implantable hearing aids are surgically inserted into the skull bone, allowing for more direct sound transmission. Non-implantable hearing aids, on the other hand, are external devices that rest on the bone behind the ear. Both types provide a solution for people with conductive or mixed hearing loss, offering different options based on individual preferences and needs.</p></p>
