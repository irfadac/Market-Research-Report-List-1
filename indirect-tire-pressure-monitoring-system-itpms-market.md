<p><h1>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) Market Furnish Information about Market Size, Market Share, Market Dynamics, and Projections Spanning from 2024 to 2031.</h1></p><p><strong>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) is designed to monitor the tire pressure indirectly through the ABS system of a vehicle. It uses wheel speed sensors to measure the rotational speed of each tire and then compares them to identify any abnormal changes in tire pressure. This system alerts the driver about any deviations in tire pressure through the dashboard display or warning light.</p><p>The iTPMS market is expected to experience significant growth during the forecast period. The growth can be attributed to several factors such as increasing vehicle safety regulations, rising consumer awareness regarding road safety, and the growing adoption of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The iTPMS helps in reducing accidents caused by underinflated or overinflated tires, providing better fuel efficiency, and increasing the lifespan of tires. These benefits are driving the demand for iTPMS in the market.</p><p>Furthermore, technological advancements in iTPMS, such as wireless connectivity and tire pressure data integration with the vehicle's infotainment system, are further fueling the market growth. Integration of iTPMS with advanced vehicle telematics systems and the development of smartphone applications for remote tire pressure monitoring are also contributing to the increasing adoption of iTPMS.</p><p>However, the high cost of iTPMS installation and complexities associated with retrofitting the system in older vehicles are expected to hinder the market growth to some extent. The need for regular maintenance and calibrations of the system also adds to the overall cost for consumers.</p><p>In conclusion, the iTPMS market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 13.5% during the forecast period. The market growth is driven by factors such as increasing safety regulations, rising consumer awareness, and technological advancements in iTPMS. However, high installation costs and complexities associated with retrofitting may pose challenges to market growth.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sensor-Type</li><li>ECU-Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The indirect Tire Pressure Monitoring System (iTPMS) market is divided into two types: Sensor-Type and ECU-Type. Sensor-Type iTPMS uses sensors inside the tire to monitor the pressure and provide real-time updates to the driver. They are more accurate but complex to install. ECU-Type iTPMS, on the other hand, relies on the vehicle's electronic control unit to monitor tire pressure indirectly through the wheels' rotational speed. Although less accurate, ECU-Type iTPMS is easier to install and therefore cost-effective.</p></p>
