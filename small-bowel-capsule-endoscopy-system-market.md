<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Bowel Capsule Endoscopy System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotating Magnetic Field</li><li>Static Magnetic Field</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Small Bowel Capsule Endoscopy System market is divided into two types: Rotating Magnetic Field and Static Magnetic Field. In Rotating Magnetic Field systems, the capsule endoscope is controlled using magnetic fields that rotate and guide it through the small bowel. This allows for comprehensive examination of the entire small intestine. Static Magnetic Field systems, on the other hand, use magnetic forces to keep the capsule in place while images are captured. Both types enable non-invasive examination of the small bowel, providing valuable diagnostic information and improving patient care.</p></p>
