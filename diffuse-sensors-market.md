<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diffuse Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ordinary Diffuse Sensors</li><li>Background Suppression Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The diffuse sensors market consists of two main types, namely ordinary diffuse sensors and background suppression sensors. Ordinary diffuse sensors emit a light beam that gets reflected back to the sensor by the target object. The presence or absence of the reflected light is then used to detect the object. In contrast, background suppression sensors use a focused light beam that can distinguish between the target object and any background or reflective surfaces. This enables more accurate and reliable detection of objects, especially in challenging environments with various surfaces and backgrounds.</p></p>
