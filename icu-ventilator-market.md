<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ICU Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ICU ventilators are medical devices used to provide respiratory support to critically ill patients. They can be categorized into two types: invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators are used when a patient requires intubation, with a tube inserted into their airway. This type is suitable for patients with severe respiratory failure. Non-invasive ventilators deliver the necessary respiratory support through a mask or helmet interface without the need for intubation. This type is typically used for patients with milder respiratory issues or who cannot tolerate invasive procedures.</p></p>
