<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Dryer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Heat pump dryers</li><li>Condenser dryers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>There are two types of electric dryers available in the market: heat pump dryers and condenser dryers. Heat pump dryers use a closed-loop system to recirculate and heat the air, making them highly energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. They extract moisture from clothes, condense it into water, and then drain it away. Condenser dryers, on the other hand, capture moisture from clothes, condense it into water, and collect it in a container that needs to be manually emptied. While heat pump dryers are more efficient, condenser dryers offer the convenience of not requiring external venting.</p></p>
