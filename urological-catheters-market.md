<p><strong>The Urological Catheters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Urinary Catheters</li><li>Dialysis Catheters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Urological catheters are medical devices used to assist in urinary drainage and dialysis procedures. Urinary catheters are specifically designed to help drain urine from the bladder when it cannot be emptied naturally. On the other hand, dialysis catheters are used in dialysis treatments, a process that filters waste and excess fluids from the blood when the kidneys are unable to perform this function. Both types of catheters play a vital role in managing urinary and kidney-related conditions, offering patients a better quality of life.</p></p>
