<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear Variable Displacement Transformer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>AC Type</li><li>DC Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Linear Variable Displacement Transformers (LVDTs) are used to measure linear displacement in various industries. The AC type of LVDT operates using alternating current and consists of a primary coil and two secondary coils on a movable core. When current flows through the primary coil, a voltage is induced in the secondary coils, which changes proportionally with the core's position. On the other hand, the DC type of LVDT operates using direct current. It contains a primary coil and a movable core, and the output voltage is directly proportional to the core's displacement. Both types of LVDTs offer precise measurements for different applications.</p></p>
