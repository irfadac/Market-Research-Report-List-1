<p><strong>The Huntington Disease Protein Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Alzheimer's Disease</li><li>Kennedy's Disease</li><li>Spinocerebellar Ataxia</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Huntington disease protein, huntingtin, has potential applications in various markets, including Alzheimer's disease, Kennedy's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, and others. In Alzheimer's disease, huntingtin levels have been found to be increased, suggesting a link between the two conditions. Kennedy's disease, a rare genetic disorder, is caused by mutations in the androgen receptor gene, which interacts with huntingtin. In spinocerebellar ataxia, huntingtin is involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. These findings suggest that targeting huntingtin protein may hold therapeutic potential for these neurological disorders and others.</p></p>
