<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Primary Antibodies Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyclonal</li><li>Monoclonal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The primary antibodies market consists of two main types: polyclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies are derived from multiple immune cells and recognize multiple epitopes, making them versatile for broad target detection. They are produced by injecting an antigen into an animal and harvesting the resulting serum containing a mixture of antibodies. In contrast, monoclonal antibodies are generated from a single type of immune cell and are highly specific for a single epitope. They are produced through genetic engineering techniques, resulting in antibodies with consistent quality and specificity.</p></p>
