<p><ul><li>Direct Vent Gas Fireplaces</li><li>Vent Free Gas Fireplaces</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gas fireplaces are available in two main types: direct vent gas fireplaces and vent free gas fireplaces. Direct vent gas fireplaces are vented to the outside, using a sealed combustion system that brings in fresh air and expels exhaust gases. These fireplaces are considered more efficient and safer, as they eliminate the need for a chimney. Vent free gas fireplaces, on the other hand, do not require any venting and can be installed anywhere. They utilize a combustion process that produces a clean burn, releasing minimal emissions into the room. However, proper ventilation is essential with these fireplaces to prevent moisture buildup and ensure air quality.</p></p>
